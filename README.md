## Conclusion 
Throughout this analysis we have got answers to some of the serious and interesting questions. We visualized trends and relations between features of apps using different types of plots such as bar graph, distribution plot, scatter plot, box plot, pie chart and more. Our analysis can be useful for future app developers and marketers in making their app a big success.

We can conclude that developers should know which type of app to develop and what will be the targeted audience. If an app can offer a premium experience to users, it might be considered keeping the app paid and offering a free trial to capture more downloads. Size of an app plays an important role in attracting users. High ratings and more reviews also attract more users. Updating the app, adding new features and fixing bugs can improve user experience and happy users attract more new users. An app getting a rating above 3.5 gets positive reviews. In this way, our analysis shows how these factors can contribute to app engagement and success.
